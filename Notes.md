- angles between neighboring points
- cubic plane curves?

  - could I use a polynomial ransac regressor? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70435375/ransacregressor-changing-base-estimator-properties-after-construction
- dot prodcut for angle between two points? -> though not exactly what I want, right?
  - this stack overflow post might be more fitting: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12229950/the-x-angle-between-two-3d-vectors
    - it might be necessary to rotate the points before projecting them onto a plane; I don't know what the better approach would be: rely on normals to determine a rotation matrix or segment a plane and use the plane equation to rotate points
    - I would be interested in the "altitude angle" between two points, this means I also would need to detrend the point cloud based on a plane to mitigate the effect a curve has on the angle (on a curved plane, the altitude angle is smaller!)
