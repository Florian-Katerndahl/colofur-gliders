# Colorful Gliders

## Overview

This Python package was developed to aid with the accuracy assessment of point clouds. Additionally, it can be used to generate mesh objects from point cloud objects, though this was only tested on small samples.

## Getting Started

Either clone this repository and use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or download the Wheel and install using pip. Please note that Open3D does not support Python 3.13 at the time of writing.

### Extras

If you wish to install jupyterlab and matplotlib alongside, chosse the "interactive" extra. Pip uses a `[]` syntax, i.e. `pip install 'colorful_gliders-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl[interactive]'` while poetry requires the `-E` flag to be set when installing.
